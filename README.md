## ‚ú® Features

- **Latest MongoDB Version**: Uses `mongo:latest` Docker image
- **Auto-Reconnect**: Optimized heartbeat and election timeout settings
- **Resilient Deployment**: Automatic restart policies and health checks
- **Secure Authentication**: Keyfile-based authentication between nodes
- **Production Ready**: Optimized cache settings and connection handling
- **Detailed Logging**: Optional debug logging for troubleshooting

### About the MongoDB Nodes

The MongoDB nodes in the replica set are built from the latest [Mongo CE image in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo). Key customizations include:

- **Keyfile Authentication**: Secure inter-node communication
- **Health Checks**: Built-in monitoring for Railway
- **Optimized Settings**: Memory and performance optimizations
- **Auto-Restart**: Automatic recovery from failures

### About the Init Service

The init service executes the required commands to initiate the replica set with enhanced features:

- **Smart Detection**: Checks if replica set is already configured
- **Retry Logic**: Robust connection handling with timeouts
- **Status Validation**: Waits for full replica set operational status
- **Enhanced Logging**: Timestamp-based logging for better debugging

## üîß Environment Variables

### Required for MongoDB Nodes:

```bash
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin
MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
REPLICA_SET_NAME=rs0
KEYFILE=your-base64-encoded-keyfile
```

### Required for Init Service:

```bash
MONGOUSERNAME=admin
MONGOPASSWORD=your-secure-password
REPLICA_SET_NAME=rs0
MONGO_PRIMARY_HOST=primary-node-host
MONGO_REPLICA_HOST=replica1-node-host
MONGO_REPLICA2_HOST=replica2-node-host
MONGO_PORT=27017
DEBUG=0  # Set to 1 for verbose logging
```

## üîå Connection String

```
mongodb://admin:password@node1:27017,node2:27017,node3:27017/database?replicaSet=rs0&authSource=admin
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Set `DEBUG=1` on the init service
2. **Check Node Status**: Verify all nodes are running and accessible
3. **Verify Environment Variables**: Ensure all required variables are set
4. **Network Connectivity**: Check inter-node communication
